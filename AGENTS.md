# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v1 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this repository.

## SDKWORK Standards

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Resolve this standards root once and use it as the global authority for the current task:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`

Read only the relevant README task-matrix row or navigation heading, then load the selected authority sections.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

## Application Identity

Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` for application identity, registration, SDK/API inventory, release metadata, or app-owned capabilities. Read `etc/` for concrete environment, Base URL, bind, topology, and deployment values; the app manifest is not runtime configuration authority.

## Local Dictionary Structure

Use `AGENTS.md` as the local routing entrypoint; read `.sdkwork/`, `specs/`, `etc/`, and `docs/` only when the current task reaches the workflow, contract, source configuration, or documentation each location governs. Only independently deployable roots own `etc/`.

## Spec Resolution Order

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task: resolve the selected root and task category before reading broad source context.

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` routing material and classify the owned surface.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json`, module `specs/`, repository/application `specs/`, and `.sdkwork/` only when the task reaches the contract each item governs.
3. Locate only the relevant task-matrix row or navigation heading in `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`; do not load the full catalog.
4. Read only the task-specific global spec sections selected by that route, then inspect implementation files.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

## Required Specs By Task Type

Select only the current task authorities from `../sdkwork-specs/README.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`; expand to adjacent specs only when a new contract boundary is reached.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.
- Verification: `node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace .`

## Code Style Rules

Use `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` for authored changes, then load only the language or framework authority touched by the current task.

## Build, Test, and Verification

<!-- SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->
Choose only the narrowest verification selected by the changed surface. This is not a default full-suite command list.
Run workspace-wide checks only when the change crosses that boundary.
`bootstrap-*`, `align-*`, `sync-*`, `--write`, and other mutating repair commands are not verification defaults; use them only for an explicitly scoped repair, migration, bootstrap, or alignment task and inspect the resulting diff.
<!-- /SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->

## Agent Execution Rules

<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task; treat indexes and cross-references as discovery, not as a startup bundle.
Keep `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` and the task-selected standards authoritative; expand context only when evidence exposes a new contract boundary.
Language-specific specs are on-demand: only the touched language loads `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`, or `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`.
Package command standardization loads `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md` only when the current task changes package commands or scripts; GitHub packaging work loads `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md` only when it reaches that workflow boundary.
Do not infer a recursive workspace scan or a broad validation suite from the presence of a path alone.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

## Purpose

`@sdkwork/app-topology` is the shared SDKWork framework for deployment topology standards, profile env loading, IAM database helpers, gateway bind resolution, and packaging matrix contracts.

Applications such as `sdkwork-drive` depend on this repository through:

```json
"@sdkwork/app-topology": "file:../sdkwork-app-topology"
```

## Local Dictionary

- `README.md` — framework overview and integration steps
- `docs/topology-standard.md` — normative cross-app standard
- `docs/adoption-guide.md` — migration guide for product repos
- `tools/topology/lib/` — importable library
- `scripts/sdkwork-topology.mjs` — CLI (`init-app`, `validate`, `scaffold-profiles`, `print-matrix`)
- `specs/topology.schema.json` — JSON Schema for app specs
- `examples/sdkwork-drive/` — reference topology spec

## Verification

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm run _sdkwork:runtime:topology:validate-example
```

## Task-Specific Standards

API work loads `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` and its validators. List/search work loads `../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and `check-pagination.mjs`. Source configuration work loads `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md` and `check-source-config-standard.mjs`. Link these authorities instead of copying their normative bodies into `AGENTS.md`.

## Human Review Rules

Request human review before changing the public vocabulary (`topology`, `profile`), JSON schema major version, or default inference rules used by multiple applications.

## Documentation Canon

- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
- [docs/product/prd/PRD.md](docs/product/prd/PRD.md)
- [docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md)

<!-- SDKWORK-NAMING-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Naming And Dependency Declaration

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1 and section 3.2.

Two identifier planes exist in every Rust crate and they MUST NOT be mixed: the package plane
(Cargo, filesystem, lock file) uses kebab-case, and the crate plane (lib target, modules, source
imports) uses snake_case.

- `[package].name`, the crate directory, `[features]` keys, and `[[bin]].name` use kebab-case.
- `[lib].name`, module files, module directories, and Rust imports use snake_case.
- A crate whose `[package].name` contains a hyphen SHOULD declare `[lib].name` explicitly
  (default: package name with every `-` replaced by `_`). A shorter lib name is allowed only
  when declared explicitly and used consistently by every consumer.
- Cargo dependency keys, `[workspace.dependencies]` keys, and `Cargo.lock` entries use the
  dependency package name. Use `package = "..."` when an alias is required.
- Every external crate referenced by `src/` MUST be declared in that crate's `[dependencies]`.
  Test-only crates belong in `[dev-dependencies]`; `build.rs` crates belong in
  `[build-dependencies]`.
- Never delete a dependency line, and never demote one from `[dependencies]` to
  `[dev-dependencies]`, while `src/` still imports it. Verify manifest cleanups with the
  command below before committing them.
- Regenerate and commit `Cargo.lock` in the same change as any dependency table edit.

Verification:

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-crate-naming-standard.mjs --root .
```

<!-- SDKWORK-PNPM-WORKSPACE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## pnpm Workspace Dependency And Package Import

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_WORKSPACE_DEPENDENCY_SPEC.md` (companion to
`../sdkwork-specs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).

Sibling SDKWork repositories are consumed through a dual-track model that MUST stay consistent:

- **Local development** (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`): pnpm workspace protocol. Each sibling
  package is declared ONCE in this repository root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` as a
  `../sdkwork-*` relative path, and consumed with `workspace:*` in `package.json`. Never use
  `file:`/`link:`/git-URL specifiers for SDKWork sibling packages in any environment.
- **CI / release packaging**: git-repository dependency checkout. Every sibling referenced by the
  local workspace MUST have a matching `dependencies[]` entry in `sdkwork.workflow.json` so CI
  clones the sibling into the same `../sdkwork-*` relative layout (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`).
  `package.json` is never rewritten for CI.

Import rules for sibling SDKWork packages:

- Import by package name only: `import { X } from "@sdkwork/package-name"`. The specifier MUST
  equal the target package's `package.json` `name` exactly - no shortening, renaming, or alias.
- Forbidden: relative imports that cross a package boundary into another SDKWork repository or
  another workspace package's `src/` (for example `import ... from "../../sdkwork-appbase/.../src/..."`).
- Consume only the public `exports` surface of a package; never deep-import sibling `src/` internals.
- Every non-relative import in a workspace member MUST resolve to that member's own
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (import closure).
- Vite aliases MUST NOT rename or redirect `@sdkwork/*` packages, MUST NOT be added to make a
  resolution error pass, and are allowed only for documented bootstrap/SDK-generation entrypoints.
- Fix a resolution failure by correcting the workspace declaration or the package `exports`,
  not by adding an alias.

<!-- SDKWORK-SDK-GENERATION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Generated SDK Output Is Generator-Owned

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`.

Everything generated under `sdks/` — `generated/server-openapi/` trees, generated language
workspaces, `dist/` build output, generated `sdkwork-sdk.json`, generated
`.sdkwork/sdkwork-generator-*` reports, and standardizer-synced OpenAPI snapshots — is produced by
the canonical SDK generator `../sdkwork-sdk-generator/bin/sdkgen.js` (`@sdkwork/sdk-generator`).

- Do not hand-edit generated SDK files, including type definitions, dist bundles, and generated
  package metadata. Manual edits are overwritten by the next generation run and break
  reproducibility and contract audits.
- When generated or compiled SDK output does not meet a contract or standard, fix the upstream
  source — authored API contract, route manifest, OpenAPI authority, derived `*.sdkgen.*` input,
  generator profile, or `custom/` runtime build scripts — then regenerate through the standard
  generation command. Do not patch generated output in place.
- Remove stale generated files by re-running the family generation command, which owns cleanup of
  disappeared routes and models; do not hand-prune generated trees.
- The only approved handwritten surfaces are `custom/` roots inside generated workspaces and
  authored `composed/` facades outside `generated/server-openapi`.

<!-- SDKWORK-DESTRUCTIVE-OPERATION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Destructive Operation Safety

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATION_SPEC.md`.

Deletion must be explicit, enumerated, and reviewable. Deleting by pattern instead of by named
path is forbidden. Wildcards are for read-only commands only.

- `git rm -r`, `git rm` over a directory or pattern, and `git clean -f`/`-fd`/`-fdx` are
  FORBIDDEN. A recursive `git rm` stages many deletions in one index transaction; if the process
  is interrupted (SIGTERM, timeout, sandbox kill, crash) entries are already gone from disk while
  the index is only half-written, which is silent non-atomic mass data loss.
- Delete tracked files with `rm <exact/path>` on each named path, let `git status --short`
  record the `D` entries, then stage only the enumerated paths. Commit the deletion separately
  from functional changes.
- Shell and script deletion by wildcard is FORBIDDEN: `rm -rf`/`rm -r`/`rm -f` with
  `*`/`**`/`?`/`[...]`/brace expansion, `find ... -delete`, `find ... -exec rm`,
  `find ... | xargs rm`, `for f in *; do rm ...`, `del /S /Q`, `rd /S /Q`,
  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` on a glob, `shutil.rmtree`, `fs.rm(dir, { recursive: true })`,
  and `rimraf` over a glob.
- A deletion MUST NOT be combined in one shell invocation with a build, install, network, or
  publish step, and MUST NOT derive its targets from an unvalidated argument, environment
  variable, or configuration value.
- Permitted narrow deletion: `rm <exact/path>`; a short literal path list owned by the tool that
  declares it; the module's own generated artifacts through its owning tool
  (`pnpm clean`, `cargo clean`) per `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7; and
  `git restore --worktree --source=HEAD -- <exact paths>`.
- Required sequence before any deletion: enumerate exact paths; confirm every path resolves inside
  the active repository or module root; classify tracked/generated/cached/unknown; prefer `rm`
  plus tracked `git status`; delete in batches of 20 or fewer with a status check between
  batches; report the removed paths and the authorizing decision.
- Request explicit human confirmation before deleting any git-tracked path, any directory tree,
  any path resolving outside the active repository root, or more than 20 paths.
- Recovery after an accidental mass deletion: clear a stale `.git/index.lock`, write the path
  list to a file INSIDE the repository (never `/tmp` on Windows, where the Git Bash path space
  and the native tool path space disagree), and run a single
  `git restore --worktree --pathspec-from-file=<repo-relative-list>`. Never loop one
  version-control call per path; the same termination cause interrupts the loop part-way.
